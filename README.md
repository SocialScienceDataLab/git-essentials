# Why to use Git and Git essentials workshop: An argument for adopting Git + GitHub/GitLab for academic research followed by a getting started workshop

📍 Online-only event

📆 April 14, 2021, 13:45-15:15

## Abstract
The workshop will have two parts: In a ca. 20-30 minute input talk, I will motivate the usage of Git and GitHub/GitLab in the context of social science research by presenting relevant features and introducing potentially relevant workflows from software development. In the second, more interactive part (ca. 1 hour), we’ll go through the typical pull-commit-push-pull request cycle which will enable participants to work with Git and GitHub, mainly using the RStudio Git interface. Prerequisites for practical workshop (installation and setup instructions will be provided 1-2 weeks before the workshop): Git installed, GitHub account, a private repository called git-tryout (initialized with a README), RStudio installed.
